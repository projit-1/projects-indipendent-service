                <h2> 1.  Difference between Authorization and Authentication</h2>
                <p> Authentication and authorization are frequently used interchangeably, they're separate processes used to cover an association from cyber-attacks. As data breaches continue to escalate in both frequency and compass, authentication and authorization are the first line of defense to help nonpublic data from falling into the wrong hands. As a result, strong authentication and authorization styles should be a critical part of every association’s overall security strategy.</p>
                <h5> Authentication vs. Authorization</h5>
                <p>Authentication verifies who the user is, whereas authorization determines what resources a user can access. Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user, and authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization. Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process. But authorization always takes place after authentication. Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user, where Authorization isn’t visible to or changeable by the user.</p>

                <p> Firebase a most popular and worldwide used a Google-backed app development platform which was initially developed by James Tamplin and Andrew Lee in 2011. This magnificent and widely used programming app was officially launched in 2012, and right after the two years of launch, Google acquired this platform. There are several advantages of using firebase, these are given by following: </p>

                <p> 1. Real-time database helps to store and synchronize data and very significantly re-useable. </p>
                <p>2. Firebase has become smarter with Google analytics.</p>
                <p>3. Firebase generally offers facility of crash reporting to fix bugs quickly and smartly.</p>
                <p>4. It also offers for fast and secured web hosting.</p>
                <p>5. Firebase authentication system is very reliable.</p>
                <p>6. Firebase allows the content storage with ease.</p>
                <p>7. Developers have the accessibility of machine learning</p>
                <p>8. Send notifications and messages to targeted audiences.</p>
                <p>9. Send the app recommendation through dynamic links.</p>
                <p>10. Generate more traffic to your app with app indexing.
                    Finally the facility of in-app advertising can’t be ignored.
                </p>
